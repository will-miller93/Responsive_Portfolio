# Responsive_Portfolio
Upgrade to the Portfolio from homework one making it responsive.

the upgrade to this was much harder because of some pretty garbage code. I think if i reworked a lot of the HTML then the responsive CSS would be much better. The main issue was the connect box inside my wrapper. I had to do this to make it work the first time and when I started the Responsive design in CSS it turned out to hurt me. 

Either way ill be looking through the HTML to see if I cant find a better code layout/formatting for my HTML.
